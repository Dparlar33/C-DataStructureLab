# Homework 4 Hashing

Write a single program in C. Create a struct array and put every information, that data.txt file consist, into that struct array. 

Array size depends on you however, use as minimum size as possible. Implement **5 different hash functions** (please be creative) and measure the performance of each hash function and output the report to the screen. If you are going to measure the effect of array size, please run 5 hash functions for every array size you tried.

Every step or instruction must be counted, especially the linear probing like collusion resolution parts. Don't use time as a measurement but use complexity analysis or instructions count as a performance measurement technique. Create your formula for the performance report. Include array size in performance measurement.

At the end of your report please show and indicate the most effective hash function and/or array size.

Please use my main.c file. Do not create a new c file. We only work with C files don't use C++ or CPP files.
Your outputs must be meaningful. Please use complete sentences.

Put a single screenshot of outputs and update this README with outputs also.

## Output:

Paste terminal output below:

Basic hashing has 167 collision

Truncation hashing has 224 collision

My first private hashing has 193 collision

My second private hashing has 182 collision

My third private hashing has 214 collision

Acoording to collision of hashings the best hashing is Basic hashing
